# Use this file to choose which role-specific actions
# to apply to each host or group. EG: if you want
# minecraft server installed, add it to the [minecraft] group.

# You can put entire groups into the children: field,
# or individual hosts under hosts:

# Children groups can also show dependencies,
# such as [media] being dependent on the [server] role
