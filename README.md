# tquin/ansible

## Requirements

* This is currently configured to run on apt-based distros only; I need to add pacman or dnf at a later stage.

* A `vault.key` file needs to be added to the root of the repo. This allows decryption of the `secrets.yaml` file.

* Run the below to install all of the third-party dependencies from Galaxy:
```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml
```

### Manual Client Setup

The only steps needed to do manually on a new machine is to install from a fresh ISO, configure a user account with a password, and add the SSH key to the Ansible controller. Everything after that, including SSH hardening, can be done via the playbook.

* Install OS from ISO
** âœ” Ubuntu Jammy 22.04
** ðŸ›  Deb Bullseye 11
* Generate an SSH key on the controller and copy it to the client
** `ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/ansible -C <email>`
** `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ansible <username>@<client>`
* Add the host info into `hosts` file
** `vi hosts`
** `[home]
<client_name> ansible_host=<client_ip> ansible_user="{{ username }}" ansible_connection=ssh ansible_ssh_private_key_file="/home/{{ username }}/.ssh/ansible"`
* Test the key is working without requiring a password
** `ansible all -m ping`
